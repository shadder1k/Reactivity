# Reactivity
Increase reactivity (reaction time): This routine is purely for increasing your reactivity. It will be hard on your body so take breaks as needed + as specified. Do not overtrain this as it will result in injury. Just listen to your body and dont be silly. I will be doing a “before and after the routine youtube vid” to show you the results after a week's use.

*Focus on reacting as fast as possible and don't predict.

The reason there is smoothness training in between is because it will force you to maintain smoothness in your aiming arm. It will be very difficult going from air to thin aiming. If you exclusively train reactivity you might end up being really jittery, while that aiming style yields super fast reaction speed I believe it’s good to keep as much smoothness as you can so you can actually track properly while being fast also.

Air is the 10x version to work on endurance because there's no point in being fast if you can't maintain it for longish periods of time.
